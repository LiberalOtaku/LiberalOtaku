            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Re: How to Interview Engineers</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">Last Updated: 3 October 2017</p>
            <p>Thanks to the power of sponsored ads, I recently found out about a company called <a href="https://triplebyte.com/">Triplebyte</a> as they constantly appeared at the top of my Facebook feed for quite some time. While I usually never give these ads any second thoughts, their blurb on Facebook piqued my interest, which led me to learn more about the company and read their <a href="https://triplebyte.com/manifesto">manifesto</a>. This was when I thought to myself: "this company sounds like one that finally understands my struggles and can help me land a job right now!" After all, every single bullet point shares my current struggles finding a paid software development job right now, but I especially agree with these two statements in particular:</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://triplebyte.com/manifesto">
              Whiteboard coding and algorithm questions aren't good predictors of how effective someone will be at writing real code. Technical hiring processes harm both excellent candidates who don't interview well and companies trying to hire good programmers.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote cite="https://triplebyte.com/manifesto">
              The hiring process should be focused on discovering strengths, not uncovering weaknesses. Everybody has weaknesses. What matters is a candidate's strengths, and how quickly they can learn new things.
            </blockquote>
            <p>Much to my dismay, however, when I created my Triplebyte account, I was immediately met with a multiple-choice knowledge quiz and two coding problems. Worst of all, there is a time limit to complete all of this, two minutes per multiple-choice question and only <i>fifteen</i> minutes per coding problem, much less than the usual thirty or sixty minutes I get in past interviews. Needless to say, I got extremely nervous when I saw the small time limit; fifteen minutes is not nearly enough time to plan and formulate an algorithm, let alone produce correct and working code. I should have known it was too good to be true. Now I would not go so far as to call every single employee at Triplebyte a liar or a hypocrite, but that was the impression I got after all of this.</p>
            <p>Later, I came across <a href="http://blog.triplebyte.com/how-to-interview-engineers">this article by Triplebyte, "How to Interview Engineers",</a> which presents some more details concerning their take on the technical interviewing process. For most of the article, they present some internal data after conducting hundreds of technical interviews as well as some advice on how to make the technical interview experience better, but they still do not fix the inherent flaws present in the interview format (just look back at the manifesto). Interviews are a direct assessment of communication ability more than anything else, including technical ability, and so they harm candidates who may not communicate well but have the best technical skills. If technical ability is something to be truly desired, then trial employment and take-home projects are simply far better indicators of technical skill than any interview ever could. They even admit in the "Why do interviews at all?" section that trial employment is a far better option for candidates.</p>
            <p>Yet at the same time, they mention two criticisms that hold trial employment (and take-home projects) back, both of which revolve around the increased time commitment from both the company and the candidate. While it may be true that such a longer time commitment can be daunting for some people, they neglect to mention candidates that do not yet have any jobs or job offers under their belt. For someone like me who still does not have any job offers, let alone a full-time job, I am much more willing to participate in a hiring process that is much more fair and can highlight my strengths more easily than any interview ever could. Plus, I highly doubt that there are so many candidates who are applying to entry-level jobs while already having other jobs or job offers at the same time.</p>
            <p>Much like the article itself, I want to end this blog post on a more positive note by sharing one simple solution to this hiring process dilemma if trial employment or take-home problems were not an option: coding samples. They can be easily added to a candidate's online application, either as a link or a direct file upload, and can give candidates a chance to explain the implementation of and reasoning for their code. This also gives a glimpse of the candidate's past experience and a direct assessment of the candidate's competency of a certain language or technology. Furthermore, this allows candidates to show off their best work and highlight their strengths, and not have to worry about the pressure and shortcomings of producing new, isolated code in an hour or less. It is simply a win-win for everyone, and I implore other companies or organizations looking to hire software developers to include this in their hiring applications if they have not already done so. It is the least they can do to give themselves a better understanding of their candidates and their technical abilities.</p>
