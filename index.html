            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Re: How to Interview Engineers</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">Last Updated: 3 October 2017</p>
            <p>Thanks to the power of sponsored ads, I recently found out about a company called <a href="https://triplebyte.com/">Triplebyte</a> as they constantly appeared at the top of my Facebook feed for quite some time. While I usually never give these ads any second thoughts, their blurb on Facebook piqued my interest, which led me to learn more about the company and read their <a href="https://triplebyte.com/manifesto">manifesto</a>. This was when I thought to myself: "this company sounds like one that finally understands my struggles and can help me land a job right now!" After all, every single bullet point shares my current struggles finding a paid software development job right now, but I especially agree with these two statements in particular:</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://triplebyte.com/manifesto">
              Whiteboard coding and algorithm questions aren't good predictors of how effective someone will be at writing real code. Technical hiring processes harm both excellent candidates who don't interview well and companies trying to hire good programmers.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote cite="https://triplebyte.com/manifesto">
              The hiring process should be focused on discovering strengths, not uncovering weaknesses. Everybody has weaknesses. What matters is a candidate's strengths, and how quickly they can learn new things.
            </blockquote>
            <p>Much to my dismay, however, when I created my Triplebyte account, I was immediately met with a multiple-choice knowledge quiz and two coding problems. Worst of all, there is a time limit to complete all of this, two minutes per multiple-choice question and only <i>fifteen</i> minutes per coding problem, much less than the usual thirty or sixty minutes I get in past interviews. Needless to say, I got extremely nervous when I saw the small time limit; fifteen minutes is not nearly enough time to plan and formulate an algorithm, let alone produce correct and working code. I should have known it was too good to be true. Now I would not go so far as to call every single employee at Triplebyte a liar or a hypocrite, but that was the impression I got after all of this.</p>
            <p>Later, I came across <a href="http://blog.triplebyte.com/how-to-interview-engineers">this article by Triplebyte, "How to Interview Engineers",</a> which presents some more details concerning their take on the technical interviewing process. For most of the article, they present some internal data after conducting hundreds of technical interviews as well as some advice on how to make the technical interview experience better, but they still do not fix the inherent flaws present in the interview format (just look back at the manifesto). Interviews are a direct assessment of communication ability more than anything else, including technical ability, and so they harm candidates who may not communicate well but have the best technical skills. If technical ability is something to be truly desired, then trial employment and take-home projects are simply far better indicators of technical skill than any interview ever could. They even admit in the "Why do interviews at all?" section that trial employment is a far better option for candidates.</p>
            <p>Yet at the same time, they mention two criticisms that hold trial employment (and take-home projects) back, both of which revolve around the increased time commitment from both the company and the candidate. While it may be true that such a longer time commitment can be daunting for some people, they neglect to mention candidates that do not yet have any jobs or job offers under their belt. For someone like me who still does not have any job offers, let alone a full-time job, I am much more willing to participate in a hiring process that is much more fair and can highlight my strengths more easily than any interview ever could. Plus, I highly doubt that there are so many candidates who are applying to entry-level jobs while already having other jobs or job offers at the same time.</p>
            <p>Much like the article itself, I want to end this blog post on a more positive note by sharing one simple solution to this hiring process dilemma if trial employment or take-home problems were not an option: coding samples. They can be easily added to a candidate's online application, either as a link or a direct file upload, and can give candidates a chance to explain the implementation of and reasoning for their code. This also gives a glimpse of the candidate's past experience and a direct assessment of the candidate's competency of a certain language or technology. Furthermore, this allows candidates to show off their best work and highlight their strengths, and not have to worry about the pressure and shortcomings of producing new, isolated code in an hour or less. It is simply a win-win for everyone, and I implore other companies or organizations looking to hire software developers to include this in their hiring applications if they have not already done so. It is the least they can do to give themselves a better understanding of their candidates and their technical abilities.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Want to See My True Abilities? Bring Me On For a Test Run!</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">Last Updated: 25 August 2017</p>
            <p>After going through numerous job interviews, both general and technical, for the past eight months and not being able to move forward in the application process after any of them, I realize now that my only big weaknesses, not being able to process new information in an extremely short amount of time and not being able to speak in a way that is fluent and natural, have overpowered my numerous accomplishments and strengths in all of these interviews. While I still believe that I am capable of both solving new problems and working with other people to solve these problems (and I do, given the numerous times I have done so in the past), these skills do not translate into an interview setting for me at all.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, I can still function normally in everyday situations. It is only under periods of intense stress, such as during an interview, when these problems arise the most. I often get flustered over any oddball or uncommon questions, and technical problems usually take me more than the 30-60 minutes given to find a solution at all, let alone find one that is the most optimal. These are not weaknesses that can be overcome by studying test questions or practicing for interviews alone. Moreover, they are not severe enough to the point where I could be fully diagnosed with an intellectual or speech disability either. So despite my academic achievements and talents, I am forced to remain disadvantaged in a job market that is already highly competitive as long as such interviews remain to be a barrier to my professional (or even academic) growth.</p>
            <p>All that being said, you might be wondering: then how was I able to land an internship with <a href="http://www.wevoteusa.org/">We Vote</a> in the first place? The answer is simple: interviews are not a good indicator of a person's abilities at all!</p>
            <p>My initial interview with We Vote proceeded like any other interview: I introduced myself and my backstory, explaining my passion for computer programming and some of the great projects that I have either created or contributed to so far, as well as learned more about We Vote and what they do. The most crucial step that made all the difference, however, came right after the interview, when my interviewer invited me to start contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/wevote/WebApp">web application</a> as a means to test my skills as well as whether or not I am a good fit for the team. After a week or two of learning React and Sass and regularly contributing to the app, it was only natural that he would offer me the internship and let me officially join the team.</p>
            <p>So if you want to see for yourself whether or not I am capable of doing a certain job, consider allowing me the opportunity to work in said job in the first place, and providing me with a problem that would take a reasonable amount of time to solve. This would not only relieve me of the concentrated pressure that hinders my performance, but also be a better indicator of my compatibility with the company or organization better than any interview ever could.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Landed an Internship . . . But Still Seeking Employment!</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">Last Updated: 11 August 2017</p>
            <p>Last month, I finally started my first software engineering internship at <a href="http://www.wevoteusa.org/">We Vote</a>, a non-profit organization that is developing a social network that aims to make ballot information more accessible to all citizens. I have been having a lot of fun with it so far as it gave me a chance to learn <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass/SCSS</a> for the first time and get some hands-on experience with both of them. Moreover, I get to work on an app that aims to promote social good as well. See <a href="https://github.com/edward-ly">my GitHub profile</a> for the latest contributions.</p>
            <p>The only downside, however, is that the position is unpaid, making it less of an internship and more of a volunteer opportunity. Nevertheless, it is something that I can add to my resume and use to find a paid job opportunity (hopefully) soon. My job hunting still continues! See my next post for details.</p>
