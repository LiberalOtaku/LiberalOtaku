            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Want to See My True Abilities? Bring Me On For a Test Run!</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">Last Updated: 25 August 2017</p>
            <p>After going through numerous job interviews, both general and technical, for the past eight months and not being able to move forward in the application process after any of them, I realize now that my only big weaknesses, not being able to process new information in an extremely short amount of time and not being able to speak in a way that is fluent and natural, have overpowered my numerous accomplishments and strengths in all of these interviews. While I still believe that I am capable of both solving new problems and working with other people to solve these problems (and I do, given the numerous times I have done so in the past), these skills do not translate into an interview setting for me at all.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, I can still function normally in everyday situations. It is only under periods of intense stress, such as during an interview, when these problems arise the most. I often get flustered over any oddball or uncommon questions, and technical problems usually take me more than the 30-60 minutes given to find a solution at all, let alone find one that is the most optimal. These are not weaknesses that can be overcome by studying test questions or practicing for interviews alone. Moreover, they are not severe enough to the point where I could be fully diagnosed with an intellectual or speech disability either. So despite my academic achievements and talents, I am forced to remain disadvantaged in a job market that is already highly competitive as long as such interviews remain to be a barrier to my professional (or even academic) growth.</p>
            <p>All that being said, you might be wondering: then how was I able to land an internship with <a href="http://www.wevoteusa.org/">We Vote</a> in the first place? The answer is simple: interviews are not a good indicator of a person's abilities at all!</p>
            <p>My initial interview with We Vote proceeded like any other interview: I introduced myself and my backstory, explaining my passion for computer programming and some of the great projects that I have either created or contributed to so far, as well as learned more about We Vote and what they do. The most crucial step that made all the difference, however, came right after the interview, when my interviewer invited me to start contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/wevote/WebApp">web application</a> as a means to test my skills as well as whether or not I am a good fit for the team. After a week or two of learning React and Sass and regularly contributing to the app, it was only natural that he would offer me the internship and let me officially join the team.</p>
            <p>So if you want to see for yourself whether or not I am capable of doing a certain job, consider allowing me the opportunity to work in said job in the first place, and providing me with a problem that would take a reasonable amount of time to solve. This would not only relieve me of the concentrated pressure that hinders my performance, but also be a better indicator of my compatibility with the company or organization better than any interview ever could.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Landed an Internship . . . But Still Seeking Employment!</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">Last Updated: 11 August 2017</p>
            <p>Last month, I finally started my first software engineering internship at <a href="http://www.wevoteusa.org/">We Vote</a>, a non-profit organization that is developing a social network that aims to make ballot information more accessible to all citizens. I have been having a lot of fun with it so far as it gave me a chance to learn <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass/SCSS</a> for the first time and get some hands-on experience with both of them. Moreover, I get to work on an app that aims to promote social good as well. See <a href="https://github.com/edward-ly">my GitHub profile</a> for the latest contributions.</p>
            <p>The only downside, however, is that the position is unpaid, making it less of an internship and more of a volunteer opportunity. Nevertheless, it is something that I can add to my resume and use to find a paid job opportunity (hopefully) soon. My job hunting still continues! See my next post for details.</p>
