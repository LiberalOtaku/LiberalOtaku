            <p>Hi. My name is Edward Ly and I am a Vietnamese-American born and raised in the Portland, Oregon metro area. I graduated from <a target="_blank" href="http://earlham.edu/">Earlham College</a> in December 2016 with a Bachelor's Degree, double majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science, and I am now pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the <a href="http://www.u-aizu.ac.jp/en/">University of Aizu</a> in Japan.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>

            <p>My biggest passion lies in computer science, as I have had an interest in and talent for computer programming ever since I was a child. Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.saturdayacademy.org/">Saturday Academy</a>, I was introduced to the world of computer science and more, from programming in Python, to making simple websites with HTML and CSS, to even developing complex video games with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yoyogames.com/">Game Maker</a>, subjects not found in my elementary, middle, or even high school. Instead, my schools recognized my talent for mathematics, which is why I believed to myself for the longest time that my career prospects lies in mathematics rather than in computer science.</p>

            <p>I was later reintroduced to computer science during my time as a student at the <a target="_blank" href="http://uoregon.edu/">University of Oregon</a>, where I attended a class that lets students develop Android applications using <a target="_blank" href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/">MIT App Inventor Beta</a>. When the professor recognized my talent for programming, that was when I knew I wanted to develop software as a career, and after I transferred to Earlham College and declared the computer science major, I now have 2.5 years of accelerated programming experience under my belt.</p>

            <p>Most of my computer science classes at Earlham were taught in the C and C++ languages, but I was also reintroduced to Python while learning about and programmed in other languages such as Scheme. All of my papers in my mathematics and computer science classes had to be written in LaTeX as well. I also have programming experience with the following C libraries and APIs:</p>

            </ul>

            <h3>Xtern Bootcamp</h3>

            <p>In the summer of 2016, I had the privilege of attending <a target="_blank" href="http://techpoint.org/xtern-bootcamp/">Techpoint's Xtern Bootcamp</a> in Indianapolis, Indiana, where I brushed up on my HTML and CSS skills, quickly picked up on the Javascript language, and learned about full-stack web development through the <a target="_blank" href="http://mean.io/">MEAN stack</a>, developing a repertoire of increasingly complex web applications along the way. My <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/edward-ly">GitHub account</a>, the many repositories in it, my expertise with the Git shell commands, and even this very website would also not be possible without the bootcamp.</p>

            <p>You can view some of these projects and more on <a href="projects.html">my projects page</a>. Topics and libraries covered in the bootcamp include:</p>

            </ul>

            <h3>We Vote</h3>

            <p>After graduating from Earlham, I found an internship working with a non-profit organization called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wevoteusa.org/">We Vote</a>, where I remotely contributed to​ ​an​ ​open-source​ ​social​ ​networking​ ​web application​ that ​aims​ ​to​ ​increase​ ​voter​ ​turnout​ ​by​ ​bringing​ ​ballot information​ ​to​ ​the​ ​voters. The front-end interface and features of the app are built with <a target="_blank" href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, both of which I have learned for the first time and gained proficiency through this internship, and are now my preferred frameworks for web development moving forward.</p>

            <h2>Present Endeavors</h2>

            <p>The internship, however, has yet to translate into a full-time software development position after more than a year working for them, so I decided to enter graduate school in the hopes of increasing my chances of exactly that. I was fourtunate enough to be accepted to the Master's degree program at the University of Aizu, where tuition is cheap (relative to US colleges) and both the student-to-faculty ratio and class size are small, facilitating an environment that I am familiar with thanks to my time at Earlham and can thrive in. In addition, not only do I get to start a new life in Japan, but I also get to follow a career path that could potentially be more rewarding and fulfilling. That is, one that combines software development with my passion for music, especially electronic music. My current research dives into the world of artificial intelligence and its applications to music, with my current research project exploring the use of genetic programming (instead of the more popular machine learning and neural networks) in music and audio effects. More details to come in the future.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>

            <p>My main hobbies include playing video games, listening to music, and watching anime. Favorite video games include most rhythm games (Dance Dance Revolution, Pump It Up, Dancerush Stardom, beatmania IIDX, to name a few), Hearthstone, and Overwatch. Favorite music genres include EDM, K-Pop, drum & bass, house, and trap. I also compose my own electronic music from time to time, with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ableton.com/en/">Ableton Live</a> being my DAW of choice. It should also be no surprise that I spend plenty of my time on the Internet as well, along with a wide range of other software I use on a daily basis.
